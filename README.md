# ESP-IR-Automation

This code is designed for deployment on an ESP-32-based system equipped with a temperature sensor, SD card module, and RTC module (refer to the provided connection schematic). The system seamlessly records temperature data at regular intervals onto the SD card. It boasts a feature to serve a 24-hour graph of temperature readings via the ESP-32 web server, offers remote control over infrared (IR) appliances through a companion app, and allows users to establish rules and instructions for scheduled activation/deactivation or temperature adjustments of appliances such as air conditioners and fans.
